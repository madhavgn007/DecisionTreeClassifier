Decision Tree Classifier

1 Overview

The present research endeavors to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of a custom-built decision tree classifier utilizing user-specified hyperparameters such as maximum depth and minimum samples split. This project aims to compare the performance of the custom-built classifier with the performance of the classifier from scikit-learn library on multiple datasets.
